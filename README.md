# Simple 3D Game

This project is a minimal example of a browser-based 3D game using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) on the frontend and a small [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server on the backend.

Run the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000> in your browser.
